# Tindeg-Progressor-RFD

A python and Tkinter desktop application for calculating Rate of Force Development (RFD). It calculates RFD100, RFD200, RFD95% and RFD20-80%.
Among these analysis, the RFD 20-80% will give the most reliable results because it does not rely on adjusting the onset threshold.

You need a Progressor to record data, it can be purchased here:

For reliable measurements:
- Tare the Progressor first
- Make sure to remove all slack in the system before pulling
- Start recording and perform the pull mid-way through the recording.

For the analysis:
-Set the RFD threshold above the initial "false" readings
